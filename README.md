# Rock Paper Scissors

This game was created using only HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

This is part of The __Odin Project's curriculum__!

Tried to create a _cool_, _basic_ and _modern_ style to focus more on the logic and coding of the app.

## Stack & Tools

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub + Mac Terminal

## What I learned

* Improved **Javascript** fundamentals: 
  - Learned how to adapt previous pure JS code to a rendered website (you can see pure JS app in [this](/original-program.js) file)
  - Better grasp of NodeList, forEach() and looping in general inside querySelector.
  - Trying to put less CSS as possibile inside JS, using it mostly to add/remove classes.
  - Improved DOM manipulation.
  - Experimented with new functions found on purpose for the project like  *.play()*  or  *location.reload()*
* Improved **VS Code usage** by downloading extensions to debug and color nesting.
* Improved **clean code** writing.
* Improved **HTML** and **CSS** fundamentals (wide use of _utility classes_)
* Improved responsivity programming with @media queries - Approach mobile-first.

## What could be improved

* Write tidier code and better JS, like creating functions to avoid repetitions and excessive nesting.
